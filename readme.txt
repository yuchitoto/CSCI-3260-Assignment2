Introduction:
	This is a wandering cat simulator. In the past, we have "fish happy
infinite" in ATV, which acts as slow tv which helps people to relax. This cat
wandering simulator works in the same way to help people to relax also. It
further enhances its effect by allowing people to control one of the cat,
Tom, by adding interaction between the scene and player.

Manipulation:
	Keyboard control:
	w: increase brightness of directional light
	s: decrease brightness of directional light
	1: set Tom to texture 1(cat1.jpg)
	2: set Tom to texture 2(cat2.jpg)
	up-arrow: move Tom forward
	down-arrow: move Tom backward
	right-arrow: rotate Tom to the right
	left-arrow: rotate Tom to the left

	Mouse control:
	When the left button clicked and the mouse moves up, the whole scene
you see moves up.
	When the left button clicked and the mouse moves left, the whole scene
you see moves right.
